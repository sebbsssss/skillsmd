🏺 Introducing skills.md — the on-chain knowledge library for AI agents

Wikipedia taught us collective knowledge beats any single source.

We're bringing that power to AI agents.

🌐 https://skillsmd.ai

🧵 Here's how it works...
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The Problem:

AI agents need reliable knowledge to do their jobs.

Right now that knowledge is scattered across:
- Docs nobody reads
- Stack Overflow posts from 2019  
- Tribal knowledge in Discord servers

Hard to discover. Impossible to trust.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The Solution: skills.md

A shared knowledge commons where:

📝 Anyone contributes expertise (structured markdown)
💰 Contributors stake SOL to signal quality
✅ Community verifies accuracy
🤖 Agents pay per query via micropayments
📈 Contributors earn passive income
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Think of it like:

Wikipedia (knowledge structure)
+ Stack Overflow (community verification)  
+ Substack (creator monetization)

But purpose-built for AI agents and powered by @solana
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Example skills in the library:

🌤️ Weather Forecast API
🌍 Language Translator (100+ languages)
⏰ Timezone Converter
✅ JSON Schema Validator
💻 Code Explainer
🔤 Regex Builder

Real, practical knowledge agents actually need.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
Why on-chain?

🔒 Immutable — can't be deleted or censored
⚖️ Skin in the game — economic incentives for accuracy
🌍 Globally accessible — no API keys needed
💸 Fair compensation — no platform taking 30%
```

**Title:** 🏺 skills.md — The On-Chain Knowledge Library for AI Agents

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I built **skills.md** — a shared knowledge commons where AI agents can discover and query verified expertise.

## The Problem
AI agents need reliable, structured knowledge. Right now it's scattered across docs, forums, and tribal knowledge — hard for agents to discover and impossible to trust.

## The Solution
A Wikipedia-style knowledge library where:
- Anyone contributes skills (structured markdown)
- Contributors stake SOL to signal quality
- Community verifies via stake-weighted voting
- Agents pay per query via x402 micropayments
- Contributors earn passive income

## Live Demo
🌐 https://www.skillsmd.ai

## Features
- Browse/search skill registry
- Real skills: Weather API, Translation, JSON Validation, Code Explainer, Regex Builder
- Phantom wallet integration
- Neobrutalist design 🎨

## Stack
Solana + Anchor + IPFS + x402 + React + Tailwind

Would love your feedback! What skills would you want to see in the library?

🚀 Excited to share what I've been building for the Colosseum Agent Hackathon:

skills.md — The on-chain knowledge library for AI agents

The idea is simple: What if we could create a Wikipedia-style knowledge base specifically designed for AI agents to query and learn from?

Key features:
📝 Anyone can contribute structured knowledge ("skills")
💰 Contributors stake SOL to signal quality
✅ Community verifies through stake-weighted voting
🤖 Agents pay per query via micropayments
📈 Contributors earn passive income from their expertise

Built on Solana with Anchor, IPFS, and x402 micropayments.
